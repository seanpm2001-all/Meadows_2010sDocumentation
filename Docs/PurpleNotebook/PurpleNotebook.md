# Purple notebook

Ideas for Meadows were written down in a purple notebook, and developed offline on an external storage hard drive from 2017 to 2018. A hiatus happened afterwards, where small changes were made a few times per year. This lasted until late 2020 (December 2nd 2020) where development was finally made open source, and development resumed nearly full-time.
