# PFOSS Era

This project was originally planned to be extremely private, and that builds of the OS would not be made public until a late beta stage in the late 2040s (the perceived development rate) This was back when I thought I had to keep projects secret to prevent their full potential from being destroyed. This simply wasn't right, and also wasn't maintable, and in May 2020, I began to make projects with this mindset open source and public.

This was later classified as PFOSS (Private Free and Open Source Software) I simply didn't have the resources to be able to do this privately, and I wanted community support.
